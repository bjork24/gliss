# Gliss

Gliss is a constraint based layout system for articles. It uses the CSS properties `width` and `max-width` instead of media queries to change the layout at different viewport sizes. You can [see a demo here](http://gliss.pgdn.us/), and the [related source code](https://github.com/scottkellum/gliss/blob/master/test-compass/sass/style.scss).

## Getting started

### Install with Compass:

In your terminal execute:

```
gem install gliss-layout
```

In your `config.rb` file write

```
require 'gliss'
```

And finally, import Gliss into your stylesheet

```
@import 'gliss';
```

### Install without Compass:

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/scottkellum/gliss/releases).

Unzip into your project and import Gliss into your stylesheet

```
@import 'gliss';
```

## Documentation

First, you are going to want to configure Gliss. Here are the main variables to define your grid:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Variable</th><th>Default</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-max-width</td><td>80rem</td><td>Max width of content container. This must be a fixed width (em, rem or px)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-gutter</td><td>1rem</td><td>Gutter width, must be same units as $max-width.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-margin</td><td>4%</td><td>Margins on either side of the content container.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-cols</td><td>12</td><td>Number of columns the grid is divided into.</td></tr>
</table>

So far this just provides you with a basic toolset, but if you want to have something more out of the box to work with, set `$gliss-modules` to `true` and define these variables as needed:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Variable</th><th>Default</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-modules</td><td>false</td><td>Generates default styles so you can get going with writing markup.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-wrapper</td><td>'article'</td><td>The wrapper for the entire article.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-text</td><td>'.text'</td><td>A block of text.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>$gliss-figure</td><td>'figure'</td><td>A figure to contain an image, media or graphic that you wish to be floated alongside the main text column.</td></tr>
</table>


Gliss is primarily designed to help out with math by providing a few mixins that set the width constraints and alignment on elements.

The primary mixin you will use is `gliss()` and you can pass the small and large constraints to it. If we wanted `foo` to be 6 columns wide at small sizes and 3 columns wide at the largest sizes then we would write it like this:

```scss
foo {
	@include gliss(6,3);
}
```

This will generate the following CSS:

```css
figure._quarter {
	width: 19.25rem;
	max-width: calc(50% + -0.5rem);
}
```

For alignment, you can choose left, right, or center by using the following mixins:

```scss
foo {
	@include gliss-center();
	@include gliss-left();
	@include gliss-right();
}
```

If you are generating Gliss modules, then use the module definitions you have created with your variables.

First off, the markup should be structure something like this:

```html
<article>
  <figure></figure>
  <div class="text"></div>
  <figure></figure>
  <div class="text"></div>
</article>
```

Gliss figures have a number of modifiers available. `._half`, `._third`, and `._quarter` set elements to be half width, a quarter width, or one third the width of the page at the max width of the layout. All three degrade to half width. `._left` and `._right` will float these figures left or right.

`._hang` is an additional figure modifier that will align the figure with the main text column and also push it flush with the side of the article. You can use `._left` and `._right` with hanging figures.

This framework is intended as a barebones toolset, not something that will solve all your layout problems for you. It is intended as a beginning to solving some tough problems, not an end and itâ€™s likely that you will find value in reworking components to fit your needs.
